# Comparison of Vue and React's Component Lifecycles

## Sources

Read Vue's [API](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Options-Lifecycle-Hooks)
and look at the [Lifecycle diagram](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram).

Read React's [guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html),
[class API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html),
and [hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)


## Unrelated cheatsheets

For Vue, there's [Flavio Copes' cheatsheet](https://flaviocopes.com/vue-cheat-sheet/),
and Vue Mastery has a great [PDF cheatsheet](https://www.vuemastery.com/vue-cheat-sheet/).

React has a good cheatsheet on devhints.io [here](https://devhints.io/react).
With React's Functional Hooks API, there's less API footprint to learn than in Vue, but the concepts are a bit deeper.


## A word on functional APIs

React's functional hooks API is a bit different to the class-based lifecycle API people are familiar with.
It addresses two main problems:
* state
* effects
